                <p class="parafo">Lee Connect empowers and inspires matriculates by assisting them with university and bursary applications.<br>
                    University applications are stressful and time consuming. Time is a crucial element for matriculants, they need all the time they can get to study. Most matriculants use their smart phones to apply however, not all students have smartphones. Additionally, funds are needed to purchase mobile data for internet access. We believe that all this is unnecessary stress for matriculants and thatâ€™s where we come in.</p>

                <p class="parafo">Lindelwa Mahlalela has constantly been passionate about education. In 2018, she started helping her friends to apply at colleges, universities and for bursaries. She came across a learner that passed with good marks but had no idea what an email was. She then realised the need to help other learners in her area and that was how Lee Connect was established.</p>
